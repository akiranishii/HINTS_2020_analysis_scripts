### Abstract
Objective: Online patient portals become important during disruptions to in-person health care, like when cases
of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other respiratory viruses rise, yet underlying structural inequalities
associated with race, socio-economic status, and other socio-demographic characteristics may affect their use.
We analyzed a population-based survey to identify disparities within the United States in access to online
portals during the early period of COVID-19 in 2020.

Materials and Methods: The National Cancer Institute fielded the 2020 Health and Information National Trends
Survey from February to June 2020. We conducted multivariable analysis to identify socio-demographic
characteristics of US patients who were offered and accessed online portals, and reasons for nonuse.

Results: Less than half of insured adult patients reported accessing an online portal in the prior 12 months, and
this was less common among patients who are male, are Hispanic, have less than a college degree, have
Medicaid insurance, have no regular provider, or have no internet. Reasons for nonuse include: wanting to
speak directly to a provider, not having an online record, concerns about privacy, and discomfort with
technology.

Discussion: Despite the rapid expansion of digital health technologies due to COVID-19, we found persistent
socio-demographic disparities in access to patient portals. Ensuring that digital health tools are secure, private,
and trustworthy would address some patient concerns that are barriers to portal access.

Conclusion: Expanding the use of online portals requires explicitly addressing fundamental inequities to
prevent exacerbating existing disparities, particularly during surges in cases of COVID-19 and other respiratory
viruses that tax health care resources.
